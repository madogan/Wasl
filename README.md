IlmGraph is an open-source project that builds a structured knowledge graph from Islamic texts — including the Quran, Hadith, Tafsir, and Fiqh — by analyzing and linking Arabic words, their roots, meanings, and historical contexts. It enables semantic search, linguistic analysis, and integration with tools like Obsidian for research and study.
